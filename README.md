# Untrained neural network based JCED for OTFS (UNN-JCED)
The implementation of the paper " Neural OTFS Receiver without Training Requirement" available at https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=11153399 

The OTFS system model is based on the code available at https://github.com/textremo/Phy_Mod_OTFS.

The simulation results of UNN-JCED can be generated by running Main.py for evaluating the SER performance across different SNR

# Implementation requirements:
python == 3.11.3

pytorch == 2.6.0 

CUDA == 12.6

Numpy == 1.26.4
